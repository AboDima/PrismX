    "rationale": "It is recommended to prevent use of user-managed service account keys, as anyone who has access to the keys will be able to access resources through the service account. Best practice recommends using GCP-managed keys, which are used by Cloud Platform services such as App Engine and Compute Engine. These keys cannot be downloaded. Google will keep the keys and automatically rotate them on an approximately weekly basis.",
